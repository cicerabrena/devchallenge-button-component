## :sparkles: **Overview**

This project is a possible solution to a challenge presented by [Dev Challenges][devchallenges] to help developers increase their habilities on stacks that they don't feel confident in by offering projects to recreate.

Find out more [here][devchallenges].

See the [FIGMA](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) of the challenge.

## :question: **Why Storybook?**

As this amazing [article](https://www.komododigital.co.uk/insights/react-storybook-why-should-you-use-it#:~:text=Storybook%20is%20a%20development%20environment,affect%20the%20behaviour%20of%20components.) says "storybook provides a sandbox to build UIs in isolation so you can develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases." As in the challenge only requested to document various states and types of a button, develop an application to this sole purpose it wasn't necessary.
